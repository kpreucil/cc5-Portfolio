                                    <p class="align-left">Proo-sl is actually my name—Katherine Preucil, spelled phonetically. I did this for both of us, because even I still struggle at times to say it correctly when asked thanks to having  struggled with my 'r' sounds when I was young. Although this problem has long since been corrected, my own last name can still trip me up. What can I say? I'm human.</p>
                                     
                                    <p class="align-left">Now I work as a freelance designer and developer through my start-up company Lavish Craft. I specialize in brand and logo development, but as you will see through my work on this site, my interests are varied and my skills are certainly not limited to my chosen specialization.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="align-left">Through Lavish Craft I help my clients develop a business identity that they and their audience love. Because I am both a designer and a web developer I am personally able to create a seemless brand experience across print media and web platforms for my customers.</p>

                                    <p class="align-left">If you had asked me 7 years ago what I was going to do with my future I can honestly say that design and development would not have even come up as an option. I went to college for fine arts and graduated with both a Bachelor of Fine Arts and an Art History minor. Clearly I wasn't thinking logically about how to survive, just following my passions. It was the best decision I could ever make and would do it all again if it means that I would end up where I am at now.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="align-left">I started my journey into design at Shillington School—an international school known for it's rigorous immersion-style lessons. I love almost everything about it. I say almost because sleepless nights to meet deadlines are killer. After working my way up to Junior Art Director at a publication and design house, I realized that there were some crucial aspects to my life that were missing. Soon thereafter Lavish Craft came about. I am once again following my passions, creating fine art and working with wonderful people. My gut hasn't steared me wrong yet and something tells me that it never will.</p>
